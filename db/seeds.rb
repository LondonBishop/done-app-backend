# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Task.create!(user_id: 1, content: "Render the first task", end_date: '14/10/2019', completed: false, priority: 'GREEN')
# Task.create!(user_id: 1, content: "Render the second task", end_date: '15/10/2019', completed: false, priority: 'YELLOW')
# User.create!(name: 'Freddy')
